    <img src="../img/chocolate-cake.png">

    <p>The best chocolate cake recipe. Ever? There are plenty of claims for the best chocolate cake recipe. I get that. But with one bite of this decadent, moist chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, every single person around the table commented that this was the best chocolate cake they’d ever tasted. Now you can make it too.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>chocolate buttercream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray, buttering and lightly flouring, or brushing them with homemade chocolate pan release.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the chocolate cake:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</li>
        <li>Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost the cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.</li>
    </ol>
